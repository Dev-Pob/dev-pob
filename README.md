## Hi there 👋, welcome in my world!

<ul>
  <li>💻Front-end Developer Wannabe</li>
  <li>🃏Card games enthusiast!</li>
</ul>

<p>
I've worked on so many different works in my early 20s that I already feel very old, but never too old for new challenges <br>
I'm developing(eheh) my devolper skills focusing on the React framework and willing to learn more in the future 🌟

I know that I lot of people are into web development right now, but I truly thing is a new way to create and communicate <br>
and I hope that design and web will get closer even more to make the World Wide Web a place to explore and always be surprised. <br>
I really hope that I will find some place where I can give everything to create the world I see.

If you want to chat or think that I can be usefull for you agency, <br> 
this is my email: francescopio.pocobelli@gmail.com
<br>
Bye👋
</p>
